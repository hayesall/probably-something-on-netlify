[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5dce3098-9f5e-41e7-9daa-1b8e469ea612/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hayesall-something-netlify-probably/deploys)

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
